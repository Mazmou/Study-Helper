Q1. What does TCP stand for?

✅ GOOD — one clearly correct option, 3 clearly wrong but plausible
Label: GOOD

Q2. What does IP stand for?

❌ WRONG — correct answer does not match evidence/facts

Correct answer given: Internet Package

Evidence clearly states: Internet Protocol

Label: WRONG

Q3. What does TCP/IP stand for?

❌ WRONG — correct answer is factually incorrect

TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol

"Transmission Control Program" is wrong.

Label: WRONG

Q4. What does IP address represent?

✅ GOOD — clear, precise, aligned with evidence

Label: GOOD

Q5. What is TCP/IP?

❌ WRONG — correct answer is incorrect

TCP/IP is not "Telecommunication Control Protocol"

It is a protocol suite combining TCP and IP.

Label: WRONG

Q6. What does TCP/IP stand for?

❌ WRONG — factually incorrect

"Transmission Control Program and IP" is incorrect terminology.

Should be Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol

Label: WRONG

Q7. What does the datalink layer...?

⚠️ AMBIGUOUS

“Datalink Layer” and “Network Access Layer” can overlap conceptually depending on TCP/IP model interpretation.

In TCP/IP terminology, this is usually the Network Access Layer, not “Datalink Layer” explicitly.

Label: AMBIGUOUS

Q8. What is a VPN?

❌ BAD EVIDENCE

Correct answer is good.

Evidence does not define VPN — it talks about packet privacy and Wi-Fi risks.

Label: BAD EVIDENCE

Q9. What does IP address uniquely identify?

⚠️ AMBIGUOUS

“A device's unique identifier” is vague.

IP does not permanently identify a device (can change, NAT etc.).

Question wording could mislead.

Label: AMBIGUOUS

Q10. What is the main purpose of TCP?

⚠️ AMBIGUOUS

Option A and C are very similar.

C is technically more complete.

Two answers could arguably be defended.

Label: AMBIGUOUS

Q11. What does TCP stand for in networking?

✅ GOOD

Label: GOOD

Q12. What protocol does TCP use for establishing connections?

❌ BAD QUESTION DESIGN

A three-way handshake is not a "protocol".

It is a mechanism used by TCP.

Label: BAD OPTIONS

Q13. What is the main purpose of IP in networking?

❌ WRONG

Correct answer marked: B

Evidence discusses TCP, not IP.

IP’s purpose is addressing and routing, not application exchange.

Label: WRONG

Q14. What is an alternative to TCP in networking?

✅ GOOD

Clear, factual, supported.

Label: GOOD

Q15. What are TCP/IP layers responsible for?

❌ WRONG

Correct answer marked: B (Encrypting email communications)

Evidence discusses packet routing & layering.

Correct answer should be C.

Label: WRONG

Q16. What protocol does TCP use before it transmits data?

❌ WRONG

TCP does not “use TCP/IP before transmitting”.

The question itself is conceptually flawed.

TCP establishes connection via handshake — not via TCP/IP.

Label: WRONG

Q17. What is the main purpose of IP?

❌ WRONG

Marked correct: C (Establish secure connections)

That is TCP/SSL behavior.

IP handles addressing and routing.

Label: WRONG

Q18. What does TCP/IP stand for?

❌ WRONG

“Transmission Control Program and Interconnection” is incorrect.

Label: WRONG

Q19. What protocols are used for email delivery?

⚠️ AMBIGUOUS

SMTP is for delivery.

IMAP is for retrieval.

Question wording “delivery” makes SMTP the strongest answer.

Multiple could be defended.

Label: AMBIGUOUS

Q20. What protocols are alternatives for TCP?

⚠️ AMBIGUOUS

UDP is correct.

TLS technically runs over TCP but is not a transport alternative.

Question wording could be clearer.

Label: AMBIGUOUS
