**Correct:** C) UDP, SSH

**Evidence:** As an alternative to TCP in networking is the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is used to establish low-latency connections between applications and decrease transmissions time.

---

## Q11. What does a datalink layer do in the TCP/IP Model?

- A) Handles the physical act of sending and receiving data
- B) Handles physical act of sending and receiving data
- C) Determines packet sequence for transmission over networks
- D) Defines how to send and receive packets between applications or devices

**Correct:** A) Handles the physical act of sending and receiving data

**Evidence:** The datalink layer defines how data should be sent, handles the physical act of sending and receiving data.

---

## Q12. What is a three-way handshake in TCP?

- A) A method to establish a connection between devices
- B) Three packets exchanged before communication begins
- C) A method to establish connection between devices
- D) Process for reassembling dropped packets

**Correct:** A) A method to establish a connection between devices

**Evidence:** As a connection based protocol, the TCP uses three-way handshake to establish a connection.

---

## Q13. What protocols are used for email transmission?

- A) SSH
- B) SMTP
- C) IMAP
- D) FTP

**Correct:** B) SMTP

**Evidence:** It is also used to send and receive email through the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), Post Office Protocol (POP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

---

## Q14. What protocols are alternatives for TCP?

- A) SSH
- B) TLS
- C) FTP
- D) UDP

**Correct:** D) UDP

**Evidence:** An alternative to TCP in networking is the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is used to establish low-latency connections between applications and decrease transmissions time.

---

## Q15. What does a datalink layer do in the TCP/IP Model?

- A) Manages flow control, ensuring all packets reach their destination.
- B) Determines packet sequencing before sending data.
- C) Handles physical act of transmitting and receiving data
- D) Defines how to send and receive packets between applications or devices.

**Correct:** D) Defines how to send and receive packets between applications or devices.

**Evidence:** The datalink layer defines how data should be sent, handles the physical act of sending and receiving data, and is responsible for transmitting data between applications or devices on a network.
